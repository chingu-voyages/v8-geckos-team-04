To start your Phoenix server:

Added by Sabrina for myself and other Elixir n00bs (I hope it is ok to add lol):
-Before doing the below steps, cd into the guess_the_language folder in the CLI.
If it asks if you want to install a missing dependency, type Y.

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
